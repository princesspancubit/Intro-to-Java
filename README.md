# Intro-to-Java
Contains my projects from my intro to java course at UCI.

<b>Assignment 2 - Objects and Classes: </b>

Learning Objectives:
    Learn how to implement classes (user defined data types).
    Understand the concept of encapsulation (hiding internal details to make usage of a class more obvious).
    Understand how to implement and use accessor and mutator methods.
    Understand how to implement constructors.
    Understand how to overload member methods.
    Learn how to solve programming problems with classes.
 
 Descriptions: 
    Excerise 1: Random Number Generator Class generates random numbers.
    Exercise 2: Egg Carton Class is similar to an egg carton. User is able to 
                add eggs to the carton and the carton is limited to 12 eggs.
                

<b>Assignment 3 - Primitive Data Types and Expressions: </b>
  
  
 Learning Objectives:
    Understand the difference between primitive data types and user-defined types (classes).
    Understand how to use the string data type.
    Understand how to use assignment operator.
    Understand how to use mathematical operations and parentheses to form expressions.

<b>Assignment 6 - Tic Tac Toe:</b>
 
 Learning Objectives:
    Develop creative problem solving skills
 
 Description:
    Created a Java console program where a user is able to play tic tac toe with a 
    computer. The computer (AI) will either win or tie. The user will never win.
